# etch-a-sketch

Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript I've built a etch-a-sketch
I'm nabbing the design from [MichaÅ‚ Osman](https://github.com/michalosman) ;)
This was made for a project whilst I'm completed The Odin Projects' foundations course.

## Features I would add, if i come back to this project:
=> Add an eraser button
=> Change the background button
=> Toggle grid lines
=> Highlight the pixel being changed
=> Change the layout to accommodate changes above
